<h1 align="center">DeskTime</h1>

DeskTime was born out of the need for the Draugiem Group to manage their many employees. An internal application was developed, and we soon realized that we'd made a tool that could be useful for many other companies. Why not offer it to them? - we thought. And so, the development began.
At DeskTime, we’re committed to accountability, transparency, and fairness. DeskTime is a product designed to increase productivity in an open and empowering environment. The added benefit? Boosting your employees and motivating them to perform at 100% of their potential.
