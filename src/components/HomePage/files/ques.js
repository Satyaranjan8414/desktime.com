    question: "Is my team's privacy safe when using a time tracker?",
    answer: "First thing’s first – DeskTime is not an employee monitoring or spy tool, but it’s no secret that some might use this kind of software in ways that aren’t employee-friendly. Managers have the right to know how their employees get the job done, but it's imperative to also value your team's time and privacy. That's why DeskTime even has a Private time feature that disables the time tracker for when you have to take care of non-work-related tasks during office hours.",

  {
    question: "How to communicate using a time tracker with your team?",
    answer: "You have to remember that time tracking is a two-way street of communication and lead by example. Yes, it gives managers an overview of what their employees are doing during the workday, but it’s also a tool to help employees show their progress and ask for help if needed. Be transparent and honest about implementing a time tracker and take the time to show its benefits. For example, DeskTime lets you set break reminders, encourage private time, and eliminate overworking so your team members feel rested, valued, and safe.",
