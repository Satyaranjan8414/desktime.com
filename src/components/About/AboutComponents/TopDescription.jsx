              DeskTime was born out of the need for the <span style={{color:"green"}}>Draugiem Group</span> to manage
              their many employees. An internal application was developed, and
              we soon realized that we'd made a tool that could be useful for
              many other companies. Why not offer it to them? - we thought. And
              so, the development began.<br/><br/> At DeskTime, weâ€™re committed to
              accountability, transparency, and fairness. DeskTime is a product
              designed to increase productivity in an open and empowering
              environment. The added benefit? Boosting your employees and
              motivating them to perform at 100% of their potential.
